# Paperwork

## The smash bureaucratic thriller

- Your objective is to get people to sign really hard to understand paperwork

### Following-up and delays

- Oftentimes people have questions (See also: delays)
- Delays are a key concept! You are brokering a signature between characters presenting a document and characters that are the signatories. Between every exchange in either direction there is a delay from 10 minutes to a week.

### Due dates vs. false deadlines

- Sometimes there is a due date on the signature
- Sometimes the character setting the due date is bluffing(!)

### Character traits

- Some characters have commitment issues
- Some characters don't trust electronic signatures
- Some characters care more and some characters care less
- Some characters are busy

### Winning and losing

- Sometimes the contract expires and YOU LOSE
- If you nag certain characters too much you will get fired and YOU LOSE
- Sometimes you can psychologically manipulate a character into agreeing that the paperwork doesn't actually need to be signed for you to move forward and YOU WIN the round without a signature(!)
